# networking-wireguard
Repo to integrate wireguard tunnels as a Neutron ML2 Driver


## Devstack Usage

Include this in your devstack local.conf file:

```
[[local|localrc]]
enable_plugin networking-wireguard https://github.com/ChameleonCloud/networking-wireguard.git main
```



## Sample local.conf for testing

```
[[local|localrc]]
ADMIN_PASSWORD=<password>
DATABASE_PASSWORD=$ADMIN_PASSWORD
RABBIT_PASSWORD=$ADMIN_PASSWORD
SERVICE_PASSWORD=$ADMIN_PASSWORD

HOST_IP=<IP for public interface>

# minimal config for neutron dev
disable_all_services
enable_service keystone mysql rabbit
enable_service q-svc q-l3 q-agt q-meta q-dhcp

enable_plugin networking-wireguard https://github.com/ChameleonCloud/networking-wireguard.git main

[[post-config|/$Q_PLUGIN_CONF_FILE]]

[wireguard]
WG_HUB_IP=$HOST_IP
```

## Design Goals

### ML2

On port create
Validate the channel properties:
In the case of a "spoke" port, a public key must be provided. The private key for the tunnel should not be generated by Neutron, nor should Neutron ever know it.
In the case of a "spoke" port, an "endpoint" can optionally be defined; this should be a stable public host/port pair that resolves to the Wireguard tunnel on the device end. This is NOT required and any device end behind a NAT will not have a stable endpoint.

When creating a hub port:
Create a new Wireguard interface (named after the port using the aforementioned convention) in the root network namespace on the Neutron node, and then move it to a tenant-specific network namespace (named like tun<project_id>). If no such namespace exists yet, create it before moving the Wireguard interface. Creating the interface in the root namespace simplifies the layer-2 configuration and importantly should obviate the need to deal with OVS or similar.
Randomly generated a new private key and assign to the interface.
Pick a free port in the 51820..52820 range for the listen port and assign to the interface.
Update the port vif_details with the public key.
Update the port vif_details with the endpoint of the tunnel, which should be the public address of the Neutron node combined with the chosen port.
The device public key and IP address provided by the user are added as a peer, with the device IP being in the AllowedIPs list.
Save the Wireguard configuration to the channel configuration repo.
Note we do not bring up the interface here!

When creating a spoke port:
Read the public_key, endpoint, and IP of the hub port. Store them on the binding vif_details in a "peers" list.

On port update
When updating a hub port:
Synchronize the list of peers to the Wireguard configuration and save the updated configuration to the channel configuration repo.
When updating a spoke port:
No changes needed.

On port delete
When deleting a hub port:
Delete the Wireguard interface associated with the port, and delete the configuration stored in the configuration repo.
When deleting a spoke port:
No changes needed.


### L3

When adding a port to a router
If the port is a hub port for a Wireguard tunnel, move the Wireguard interface to the router's network namespace instead of creating a new veth pair and assigning an IP address. Bring up the tunnel interface.

When removing a port from a router
If the port is a hub port, move the Wireguard interface back to the default namespace and bring down the tunnel interface.
